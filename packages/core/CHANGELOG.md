# @cavemem/core

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- cd52b4b: Remote mode: one central worker owns the store. `settings.remote.url` switches a machine to POST hooks to `/api/hooks/:event` and use MCP over streamable HTTP at `/mcp`. Worker gains `workerHost` and `workerAllowedHosts`. Installers write URL-based MCP entries in remote mode. The worker requires auth on every route except `/healthz`: `/api/*` and `/mcp` stay bearer-only, and viewer HTML (`/`, `/sessions/:id`) authenticates via a one-time handshake that trades a single-use nonce (minted via bearer-protected `POST /api/viewer-session`) for an `HttpOnly`/`SameSite=Strict` session cookie — a plaintext-memory viewer is never reachable unauthenticated once `workerHost` binds off loopback, and the durable bearer token never appears in a URL, browser history, or a spawned opener's process arguments. Spool replay is bounded by a whole-batch wall-clock budget of `2 × remote.timeoutMs`, so a slow-but-responsive server cannot stretch a hook across ten individually-legal replays; the remainder drains on the next successful hook.

## 0.3.0

### Patch Changes

- b5976a5: Wire up the three privacy settings that existed in the schema but had no consumer:

  - **config/hooks (#48):** `privacy.excludePatterns` is now enforced in
    `post-tool-use.ts`. A tool call whose `file_path` / `path` / `notebook_path`
    field — or a path-like token embedded in its input/output (e.g. a Bash
    command) — matches an `excludePatterns` glob is skipped entirely; nothing
    about the excluded content is stored or logged. Glob matching (`**` across
    path segments, `*` within a segment) is a hand-rolled linear segment
    matcher (`matchesGlob`) in `@cavemem/config` — no regex construction, so
    repeated-globstar patterns cannot backtrack pathologically, and no new
    dependency. Windows backslash paths are normalized to `/` before matching.
  - **compress/core (#49):** `redactSecrets` was a documented setting with no
    effect. Added `redactSecrets(text)` to `@cavemem/compress`, scrubbing
    Bearer tokens, OpenAI-style `sk-` keys, AWS `AKIA…` access key ids, GitHub
    `gh[pousr]_` tokens, `key = value` / `key: value` assignments whose key
    name ends in a recognised secret word (`api_key`, `secret`, `token`,
    `password`, `passwd`, `authorization`, or a `_key`/`-key` suffix —
    env-var prefixes like `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` included), and PEM private key
    blocks with `[REDACTED]` (keeping the leading key name for assignments).
    `MemoryStore.addObservation` and `addSummary` now run it before
    compression when `settings.privacy.redactSecrets` is true (the default),
    independent of the existing `redactPrivate` (`<private>` tag) stripping.
    The schema's `redactSecrets` description previously claimed it stripped
    `<private>` tags — corrected to describe actual secret scrubbing.
  - **config/hooks (#50):** Added `capture.excludeTools` / `capture.includeTools`
    (both default `[]`, same glob semantics as above, e.g. `"mcp__broker__*"`).
    `post-tool-use.ts` consults them before storing: `excludeTools` always wins
    over `includeTools`; a non-empty `includeTools` makes capture opt-in to
    just those tools.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 416957b: Wire embeddings end-to-end and make lifecycle obvious.

  **Embeddings (previously dead code) now work out of the box**

  - New `@cavemem/embedding` package exports `createEmbedder(settings)` with three providers: `local` (Transformers.js, default — `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384 dim), `ollama`, and `openai`. `@xenova/transformers` is an optional dependency: installs automatically with `npm install -g cavemem` on supported platforms, falls back gracefully otherwise.
  - The worker now runs an embedding backfill loop: polls `observationsMissingEmbeddings`, embeds the expanded (human-readable) text, persists. On startup it drops rows whose model differs from settings so switching providers never pollutes cosine ranking.
  - Storage gains a model/dim filter on `allEmbeddings()` plus `dropEmbeddingsWhereModelNot`, `countObservations`, `countEmbeddings`, and a model-scoped variant of `observationsMissingEmbeddings`.
  - The `Embedder` interface in `@cavemem/core` now exposes `model` and `dim` so the store can reject mismatched rows before cosine computation.
  - Both the CLI `search` command and the MCP `search` tool instantiate the embedder lazily and pass it into `MemoryStore.search`. Semantic search is on by default; `cavemem search --no-semantic` bypasses it.
  - Worker writes a `worker.state.json` snapshot after every batch so `cavemem status` can show "embedded 124 / 200 (62%)" without hitting HTTP.

  **Lifecycle (previously unclear) is now ergonomic**

  - Hooks auto-spawn the worker detached + pidfile-guarded when it is not running (fast path < 2 ms; full `stat` + `process.kill(pid, 0)` probe). Respects `CAVEMEM_NO_AUTOSTART` for deterministic tests. Skipped when `embedding.autoStart=false` or `provider=none`.
  - Worker idle-exits after `embedding.idleShutdownMs` (default 10 min) of no embed work and no viewer traffic. No launchd/systemd integration needed.
  - New top-level `cavemem start`, `cavemem stop`, `cavemem restart`, and `cavemem viewer` commands — thin wrappers around the existing pidfile-managing implementation.

  **Config UX**

  - New `cavemem status` top-level command: single-pane dashboard showing settings path, data dir, DB counts, installed IDEs, embedding provider/model, backfill progress, worker pid and uptime.
  - New `cavemem config show|get|set|open|path|reset` command backed by zod `.describe()` — the schema is self-documenting; no parallel docs to maintain.
  - New `settingsDocs()` export from `@cavemem/config` returns `[{path, type, default, description}]` for every field.
  - `cavemem install` now prints a multi-line "what to try next" block explaining that there is no daemon to start, and surfaces the embedding model + weight-download cost.
  - Settings schema gains `embedding.batchSize`, `embedding.autoStart`, and `embedding.idleShutdownMs` — every field now has a `.describe(...)` string.

  **MCP server**

  - Lazy-singleton embedder resolution — MCP handshake stays fast; model loads on first `search` tool call.
  - New `list_sessions` tool.

  **Non-negotiable rule update**

  - CLAUDE.md now documents the "no daemon on the write path" invariant: hooks may detach-spawn the worker but must never wait on it; observations write synchronously.
