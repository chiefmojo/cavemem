# @cavemem/mcp-server

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- cd52b4b: Remote mode: one central worker owns the store. `settings.remote.url` switches a machine to POST hooks to `/api/hooks/:event` and use MCP over streamable HTTP at `/mcp`. Worker gains `workerHost` and `workerAllowedHosts`. Installers write URL-based MCP entries in remote mode. The worker requires auth on every route except `/healthz`: `/api/*` and `/mcp` stay bearer-only, and viewer HTML (`/`, `/sessions/:id`) authenticates via a one-time handshake that trades a single-use nonce (minted via bearer-protected `POST /api/viewer-session`) for an `HttpOnly`/`SameSite=Strict` session cookie — a plaintext-memory viewer is never reachable unauthenticated once `workerHost` binds off loopback, and the durable bearer token never appears in a URL, browser history, or a spawned opener's process arguments. Spool replay is bounded by a whole-batch wall-clock budget of `2 × remote.timeoutMs`, so a slow-but-responsive server cannot stretch a hook across ten individually-legal replays; the remainder drains on the next successful hook.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- dec94ef: Opt-in web-search enrichment MCP tool (#55), phase 1.

  - **config (#55):** New `enrich` settings block: `enrich.enabled` (default `false`), `enrich.maxResults` (default 3, max 5), `enrich.timeoutMs` (default 8000). Off by default — when off, the enrich MCP tool is not registered and no network call is ever made. Picked up automatically by `cavemem config show` / `settingsDocs()`.
  - **compress (#55):** New `redactSecrets(text)` export that masks common API-key shapes (OpenAI/Stripe `sk-…`, GitHub `ghp_`/`github_pat_`, AWS `AKIA…`, Slack `xox…`) as `[REDACTED]`. Gated by `settings.privacy.redactSecrets` at call sites.
  - **mcp-server (#55):** New `enrich(query, note?)` tool, registered only when `enrich.enabled` is `true`. Searches DuckDuckGo's HTML endpoint (no API key), parses the top results with a hand-rolled linear-time parser, fetches each result page with a 500 KB byte cap and per-request timeout, strips it to plain text, and truncates to 2000 chars. Extracts are stored through `MemoryStore.addObservation` (compressed, privacy-redacted) under a dedicated synthetic `enrich` session, tagged `metadata: { source: 'web', url, query, note? }` for provenance; `query`/`note` are run through `redactPrivate` + `redactSecrets` before storage, and source URLs survive compression byte-for-byte. The tool returns `{ query, results: [{ title, url, extract, observation_id }], stored_ids }`. **SSRF-hardened:** every fetched URL and each manually-followed redirect hop (max 3) must be http(s) to a public host — loopback, RFC1918, link-local (`169.254/16`), and unique-local targets (including obfuscated numeric literals) are rejected without a request. Search failure returns an MCP error with nothing stored; individual blocked or dead result pages are skipped.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- c756051: fix(mcp): boot stdio server when invoked via `cavemem mcp`

  The CLI's `mcp` subcommand did `await import('@cavemem/mcp-server')` expecting
  the import side-effect to start the server, but the server module guards
  `main()` behind an `isMainEntry()` check. When dynamically imported,
  `import.meta.url` does not match `process.argv[1]` (the CLI), so `main()`
  never ran and no MCP tools were exposed to the host IDE. Export `main()` from
  the server module and have the CLI call it explicitly. The `isMainEntry()`
  guard remains so the `cavemem-mcp` bin still works when invoked directly.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 416957b: Wire embeddings end-to-end and make lifecycle obvious.

  **Embeddings (previously dead code) now work out of the box**

  - New `@cavemem/embedding` package exports `createEmbedder(settings)` with three providers: `local` (Transformers.js, default — `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384 dim), `ollama`, and `openai`. `@xenova/transformers` is an optional dependency: installs automatically with `npm install -g cavemem` on supported platforms, falls back gracefully otherwise.
  - The worker now runs an embedding backfill loop: polls `observationsMissingEmbeddings`, embeds the expanded (human-readable) text, persists. On startup it drops rows whose model differs from settings so switching providers never pollutes cosine ranking.
  - Storage gains a model/dim filter on `allEmbeddings()` plus `dropEmbeddingsWhereModelNot`, `countObservations`, `countEmbeddings`, and a model-scoped variant of `observationsMissingEmbeddings`.
  - The `Embedder` interface in `@cavemem/core` now exposes `model` and `dim` so the store can reject mismatched rows before cosine computation.
  - Both the CLI `search` command and the MCP `search` tool instantiate the embedder lazily and pass it into `MemoryStore.search`. Semantic search is on by default; `cavemem search --no-semantic` bypasses it.
  - Worker writes a `worker.state.json` snapshot after every batch so `cavemem status` can show "embedded 124 / 200 (62%)" without hitting HTTP.

  **Lifecycle (previously unclear) is now ergonomic**

  - Hooks auto-spawn the worker detached + pidfile-guarded when it is not running (fast path < 2 ms; full `stat` + `process.kill(pid, 0)` probe). Respects `CAVEMEM_NO_AUTOSTART` for deterministic tests. Skipped when `embedding.autoStart=false` or `provider=none`.
  - Worker idle-exits after `embedding.idleShutdownMs` (default 10 min) of no embed work and no viewer traffic. No launchd/systemd integration needed.
  - New top-level `cavemem start`, `cavemem stop`, `cavemem restart`, and `cavemem viewer` commands — thin wrappers around the existing pidfile-managing implementation.

  **Config UX**

  - New `cavemem status` top-level command: single-pane dashboard showing settings path, data dir, DB counts, installed IDEs, embedding provider/model, backfill progress, worker pid and uptime.
  - New `cavemem config show|get|set|open|path|reset` command backed by zod `.describe()` — the schema is self-documenting; no parallel docs to maintain.
  - New `settingsDocs()` export from `@cavemem/config` returns `[{path, type, default, description}]` for every field.
  - `cavemem install` now prints a multi-line "what to try next" block explaining that there is no daemon to start, and surfaces the embedding model + weight-download cost.
  - Settings schema gains `embedding.batchSize`, `embedding.autoStart`, and `embedding.idleShutdownMs` — every field now has a `.describe(...)` string.

  **MCP server**

  - Lazy-singleton embedder resolution — MCP handshake stays fast; model loads on first `search` tool call.
  - New `list_sessions` tool.

  **Non-negotiable rule update**

  - CLAUDE.md now documents the "no daemon on the write path" invariant: hooks may detach-spawn the worker but must never wait on it; observations write synchronously.
